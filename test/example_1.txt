Q: What is the shape of the pier cap?  
A: The shape of the pier cap is a rectangular shape with one longer side extended into a trapezoidal form.  

Q: What is the area of the pier cap?  
A: The shape of the pier cap is a combination of two different shapes, a rectangle and a trapezoid. First, we will calculate the area of the trapezoidal portion, and then we will calculate the area of the rectangle. To find the total area of the pier cap, we need to add the area of the trapezoidal portion to the area of the rectangle.\nThe length of the large horizontal side of the trapezoid is 3000 mm, the length of the small horizontal side of the trapezoid is 2250 mm, and the height of the trapezoid is 800 mm.\nThe area of the trapezoidal portion = (0.5 * (3000 + 2250) * 800) = 2100000 mm²\nThe length of the rectangle is 3000 mm, and the width of the rectangle is 1000 mm. The area of the rectangular portion = (3000 * 1000) = 3000000 mm²\nThe area of the pier cap = Area of trapezoid + Area of rectangle = (2100000 + 3000000) mm² = 5100000 mm².
