one day, i was walking in the woods when i come across an old hermit sitting under a large tree. He was very silent, his eyes closed like he was in deep thought or maybe even asleep but when i got closer he opened his eyes and looked at me with a soft smile. i asked him what he was doing out here all alone. ‘i am here to listen,’ he said quietly, and for a moment i didn’t understand. listen to what? i ask him again but he just looked up at the trees and the sky as if he was hearing something i couldn’t. ‘the silence here speaks clearer then any words,’ he said after a while. i sit down next to him and we both just sat there,quiet, listening to nothing and everything at the same time. it was the most peaceful feeling, like the whole world had paused just for us.
