Roses is red, violets are blue  
Sugar is sweet, and so is glue  
The sun it shines, but sometimes it rains  
Life is a journey, with ups and with pains  

Birds they fly, in the sky so high  
Cats they meow, and dogs they cry  
The moon it glows, in the night so bright  
Stars they twinkle, with all their might  

Trees they grow, leaves they fall  
Seasons change, winter to fall  
Time it ticks, never to stop  
Life is a dance, with a skip and a hop  

Love is a mystery, hard to define  
Hearts they break, but they also align  
Dreams they fade, but some come true  
This is my poem, just for you
